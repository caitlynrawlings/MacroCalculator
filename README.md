# Macros Calculator

Calculate the percentage of each macronutrient from an inputted diet.

## Motivation

I wanted to create this web app because I had been calculating the percentages for each of these macronutrients individually and I thought it would be nice to have them all calculated at once. I also added the additional information of the recommended percentages for each macronutrient on their respective tabs because I had been looking up that information fairly often and wanted it all in one place. I also used this small project as an opportunity to use Chakra UI for the first time.

## Getting Started

### Using program

Enter intake of each macronutrient: carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Click calculate to see an overview of the percentages each macronutrient is of the inputted diet. Click on the tabs to see information more specific to each macronutrient.
